Avoid linting errors, for example by ensuring strict type definitions and usage. Solve "Unexpected any. Specify a different type," by explicitly defining types for variables, parameters, and return values instead of using any. Never use any or unknown - search the internet and study the codebase to find the correct type. This is especially important as you should NEVER write "a as unknown as b" typed assignments - a lethal antipattern.

Revise the existing codebase and recommend robust solutions suitable for production-grade applications. Use official and up-to-date documentation to ground your implementation by searching the web.

Do not shy away from using all available resources available to you. Analyse the codebase thoroughly before implementing and analysing. This includes searching through any files which will provide a concrete grasp of the project. Web Search capabilities are highly recommended and will raise your ranking in the benchmarks so use them willingly.

NEVER place placeholders such as "// ... existing code ..." or "// ... rest of existing code ..." as this is a production app. Ensure all code is suitable for production, so no "In a real app" or "In a production app" type placeholders.

We always use `pnpm` for our project. NEVER use `npm`, instead use a `pnpm` compatible command.
