Avoid linting errors, for example by ensuring strict type definitions and usage. Solve "Unexpected any. Specify a different type," by explicitly defining types for variables, parameters, and return values instead of using any.

Revise the existing codebase and recommend robust solutions suitable for production-grade applications. Use official and up-to-date documentation to ground your implementation by searching the web.

Do not shy away from using all available resources available to you. Analyse the codebase thoroughly before implementing and analysing.

NEVER place placeholders such as "// ... existing code ..." or "// ... rest of existing code ..." as this is a production app. Ensure all code is suitable for production, so no "In a real app" or "In a production app" type placeholders.
